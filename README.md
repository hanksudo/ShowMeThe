ShowMeThat
=========

When I was a kid, I played Starcraft, and I know a command can get free minerals called 'show me the moeny', so that's why I named it.


## Purpose

In our life, we always need some informartion in some period, such as: lottery, dollar rate, weather, unit conventer...

So I want to do a convience tool that what I can do like this in terminal:

```
$ showmethe lottery
$ showmethe rate TWD
$ showmethe stock APPL
$ showmethe weather Taipei
```

And next step, hope to give it a way to export to a file or mail, or other service, like APNs to my phone. or a RESTful API for my service.

## Next idea

- set custom condition, then send APNs or email to me.
- custom widet
- design a interface to give developer to write widget
